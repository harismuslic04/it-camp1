        The 2019 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2018–19
        UEFA Champions League, the 64th season of Europe's premier club football
        tournament organised by UEFA and the 27th season since it was rebranded
        the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in
        Madrid, Spain on 1 June 2019,[5] between English sides Tottenham Hotspur
        (in their first European Cup final) and Liverpool (in their ninth
        overall and their second in a row, having been defeated by Real Madrid
        in 2018). It was the seventh Champions League final – and the fourth of
        the decade – to feature two teams from the same association, and the
        second all-English final (the first was in 2008). It was also the first
        final since 2013 to not feature at least one Spanish team, with Real
        Madrid and Barcelona having shared the previous five titles between
        them.
